Matrix Generator

this generators a matrice of random numbers to create practice problems. 

Not all matrices will have valid solutions, but this is just for practice.  

Which is useful for students trying to find practice problems while studying linear algebra. 

Additionally with slight modification of the code they can have problems of different sizes and as well as more difficult numbers. 

This study tool can be adapted to a person's skills.
